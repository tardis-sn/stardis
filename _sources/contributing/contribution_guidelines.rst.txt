Contribution Guidelines
=======================

If you are looking to contribute to STARDIS, then you’ve found the right
place! Whether your looking to fix a typo somewhere in this very
documentation, or fix a bug thats gone unnoticed, then hopefully what
you read here will help.

Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer
----------------------------

*We want your help. No really, we do.*

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you’re not ready;
that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or
write a few more blog posts before you can help us with this project.

We assure you, that’s not the case.

STARDIS has some clear Contribution Guidelines that you can read below
in the following sections.

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you’ll need to
follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process
explicit, we hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don’t just have to write code. You can help out by writing
documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And
yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

(Thanks to `Adrienne
Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend/imposter-syndrome-disclaimer>`__
who came up with this disclaimer and yeah, made it OPEN for anyone to
use!)

How can I Contribute?
---------------------

   understand? Edit it!

Reporting a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STARDIS is in active development. There’s no surprise that you may
encounter something that doesn’t work for your use case. Or maybe you
have some suggestions about how can we improve some functionality. Feel
free to share any of it with us by `opening an
issue <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue>`__
on the `STARDIS Github
project <https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis/issues>`__.

Please make sure that you provide all the necessary information
requested by prompts in the issue body - it will not only make our work
easier but will also help you to communicate your problem better.

Editing the Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation can always be improved upon by adding missing information
or making it easier to read. Lucky for you, you can make edits and fixes
to the documentation pages that are stored in the ``docs`` directory of
STARDIS. The majority of STARDIS documentation is made using Jupyter
Notebooks and Markdown, which you can learn more about
`here <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/markdown-cell-in-jupyter-notebook/>`__.

Making a Patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have peeked in our codebase and realized how you can fix a
problem or if you know how to add a new feature, well done! If not,
don’t worry - just pick a `Github
issue <https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis/issues>`__ that you think
you can fix and give it a try.
