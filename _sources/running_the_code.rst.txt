Running the Code
================

The ``run_stardis()`` Function
------------------------------

In the `Quickstart <quickstart/quickstart.ipynb>`__, there is a basic notebook that
runs STARDIS and plots a spectrum. The main function, ``run_stardis()``,
requires as its first argument the name of a configuration file, which
will be described below. The second argument is an array of the
frequencies or wavelengths for which you are requesting the flux
density, times an appropriate astropy quantity (such as Hertz or
Angstroms). Note that this must be an array times a quantity, **not** an
array of astropy quantities.

The STARDIS Configuration
-------------------------

STARDIS uses `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`__ files for the configuration.
The `quickstart notebook <quickstart/quickstart.ipynb>`__ uses an example configuration called ``stardis_example.yml``.
Below, we present an example for instructions for customizing the
configuration for your needs.

.. code:: yaml

   stardis_config_version: 1.0
   atom_data: <filepath to atomic data file>
   model:
       type: marcs # more options will be available in the future
       fname: <filepath to MARCS model file>
       final_atomic_number: <atomic number of largest element considered> # may be up to 30
   opacity:
       file: # reads a bound-free or free-free opacity file, omit if none
           <species1>_<either bf for bound-free or ff for free-free>: <filepath to opacity file>
           <species2>_<either bf for bound-free or ff for free-free>: <filepath to opacity file>
           ...
       bf: # uses the hydrogenic approximation for bound-free opacity, omit if none
           <species1>: {} # there will eventually be options to include files with gaunt factors or departure coefficients
           <species2>: {}
           ...
       ff: # uses the hydrogenic approximation for free-free opacity, omit if none
           <species1>: {} # there will eventually be options to include files with gaunt factors or departure coefficients
           <species2>: {}
           ...
       rayleigh: <list of species considered for rayleigh scattering> # may include H, He, and/or H2, omit or use [] for none
       disable_electron_scattering: <True or False>
       line: # settings for line interaction opacity, at least one subfield is required
           disable: <True or False>
           broadening: <list of non-thermal broadening sources considered> # may include radiation, linear_stark, quadratic_stark, and/or van_der_waals, omit or use [] for none
           min: <minimum resonance frequency or wavelength of lines considered> # must have units, such as Hz or AA
           max: <maximum resonance frequency or wavelength of lines considered> # must have units, such as Hz or AA
           broadening_range: <maximum distance in frquency space to the resonant frequency for line broadening to be considered> # necessary for computational efficiency and must have units, 1e13 Hz recommended
   no_of_thetas: <number of angles to sample for raytracing>

In fields where an atomic species is requested, the species must be in
the form ``<atomic symbol>_<ionization roman numeral>``. For example,
``H_I`` for neutral hydrogen, or ``Si_III`` for twice-ionized silicon.

Additionally, in the opacity file section, the following entries are
valid: - ``Hminus_bf`` - ``Hminus_ff`` - ``Heminus_ff`` - ``H2minus_ff``
- ``H2plus_ff``

Opacity File Format
-------------------

STARDIS can read and interpolate continuum opacity cross-section files
for bound-free or free-free absorption (technically, for free-free
absorption the files would provide the cross-section per electron
density). The files must be one of the following formats:

.. code:: csv

   wavelength_1, cross-section_1
   wavelength_2, cross-section_2
   wavelength_3, cross-section_3
   ...

or

.. code:: csv

   , temperature_1, temperature_2, temperature_3, ...
   wavelength_1, cross-section_11, cross-section_12, cross-section_13, ...
   wavelength_2, cross-section_21, cross-section_22, cross-section_23, ...
   wavelength_3, cross-section_31, cross-section_32, cross-section_33, ...
   ...

Note the leading comma in the latter format. Temperatures must be in
Kelvin, wavelengths in Angstroms, and cross-sections in cm^2 for
bound-free or cm^5 for free-free (once again because free-free opacity
files provide the cross-section per electron density).
