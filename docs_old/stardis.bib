	abstract = {We present TARDIS - an open-source code for rapid spectral modelling of supernovae (SNe). Our goal is to develop a tool that is sufficiently fast to allow exploration of the complex parameter spaces of models for SN ejecta. This can be used to analyse the growing number of
high-quality SN spectra being obtained by transient surveys. The code uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain a self-consistent description of the plasma state and to compute a synthetic spectrum. It has a modular design to facilitate the implementation of a range of physical
approximations that can be compared to assess both accuracy and
computational expediency. This will allow users to choose a level of sophistication appropriate for their application. Here, we describe the operation of the code and make comparisons with alternative radiative transfer codes of differing levels of complexity (SYN++, PYTHON and ARTIS). We then explore the consequence of adopting simple prescriptions for the calculation of atomic excitation, focusing on four species of relevance to Type Ia SN spectra - Si II, S II, Mg II and Ca II. We also investigate the influence of three methods for treating line
interactions on our synthetic spectra and the need for accurate
radiative rate estimates in our scheme.},

Radiative transfer in gaseous media that are neither optically thin nor fully opaque and scatter to boot is a key part of astrophysics but not a transparent subject. These course notes represent a middle road between Mihalas' "Stellar Atmospheres" (graduate level and up) and the books by Novotny and Boehm-Vitense (undergraduate level). They are at about the level of Gray's "The observation and analysis of stellar photospheres" but emphasize NLTE radiative transfer rather than observational techniques and data interpretation.},

Our equation of state model, known as ChemEOS, is based on the minimization of free energy in a chemical picture and appears to be a reasonable and robust approach to determining atomic state populations over a wide range of temperatures and densities. In this paper we discuss in detail the calculations that we have performed for the 30 elements considered, and present some comparisons of our monochromatic opacities with measurements and other opacity codes. We also use our new opacity tables in solar modeling calculations and compare and contrast such modeling with previous work.},

Until now no set of data exists that would meet this need in a fully satisfactory way. We have therefore undertaken to produce a table of very accurate non-relativistic Gaunt factors over a much wider range of parameters than has ever been produced before. We first produced a table of non-averaged Gaunt factors, covering the parameter space 10log ϵi = −20 to +10 and 10log w = −30 to +25. We then continued to produce a table of thermally averaged Gaunt factors covering the parameter space 10log γ2 = −6 to +10 and 10log u = −16 to +13. Finally, we produced a table of the frequency integrated Gaunt factor covering the parameter space 10log γ2 = −6 to +10. All the data presented in this paper are available online.},

	abstract = {We define stellar envelopes to be those regions of stellar interiors in which atoms exist and are not markedly perturbed by the plasma environment. Availability of accurate and extensive atomic data is a prime requirement for the calculation of envelope opacities. For envelopes we adopt the criterion of mass density \${\textbackslash}rho {\textbackslash}le 0.01{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm g\} {\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash}\$.We present radiative Rosseland mean opacities for envelopes obtained using atomic data calculated in an international collaboration referred to as the Opacity Project, or OP. Equations of state are calculated using an occupation-probability formalism. To a good approximation, ionization equilibria and level populations in envelopes depend only on the temperature T and electron density \$N\_{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}{\textbackslash}\$ and are insensitive to chemical mixtures. Monochromatic opacities for all abundant chemical elements are therefore calculated on a grid of (\$T,{\textbackslash} N\_{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}{\textbackslash}\$) values and are archived. Rosseland mean opacities are then readily calculated for any chemical mixture. Tables of Rosseland means, for any required mixtures and as functions of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ and T, are available on request in computer-readable form.The present, op, results are compared with those from another recent study, referred to as opal, by C. A. Iglesias and F. A. Rogers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The agreement between the op and opal calculations is generally good, although there are some differences. Both calculations give results larger than those obtained in earlier work, by factors of up to 3 or more.},
